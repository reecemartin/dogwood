# Workflow

This document describes the approximate workflow of Dogwood. 

## Initial Setup

When a teacher adds the Dogwood app to their course and opens it up for the first time, they will be prompted to set up the course with Dogwood. 

1. Teacher grants permission for the app to access course material
2. Dogwood scans all assignments & documents available in the course
3. Dogwood adds comment anchors to each assignment (at each section)
4. The app is ready to use for users to comment on an assignment

## User Comment

Users can either add a question at any location (anchor) in a document, post/edit an answer to an existing question, comment on an existing question chain, or leave a general comment/reply on the assignment as a whole.
